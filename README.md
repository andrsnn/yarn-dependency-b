An attempt to reproduce the "Fetching packages" issue found [here.](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/764)

Clone this module.

Running `yarn cache clean; yarn;` should reproduce the problem, but as this problem appears to be due to a race condition, the install will sometimes succeed.

If your install succeeds run `run.sh` in the root until yarn hangs.
